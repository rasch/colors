ðŸŒˆ a collection of color palettes

These color palettes were originally created in the early days of SCSS
because I was building a portfolio website for my landscape design
projects and wanted my site's color scheme to match my drawings. At the
time, I was using mostly [Chartpak ADÂ® Markers][1] and [PrismacolorÂ®
Colored Pencils][2]. I ended up only using these in a few web projects
but found them very helpful for coming up with color schemes for
traditional drawing.

I made a little [website to show all the color swatches][3]. It uses
keybindings to change between color palettes and the sort order of the
colors.

## keybindings

- `p`: go to next color palette
- `P`: go to previous color palette
- `h`: sort by hue
- `s`: sort by saturation
- `v`: sort by value
- `r`: sort by red
- `g`: sort by green
- `b`: sort by blue
- `n`: sort by name (alphabetical)
- `x`: sort by hex color
- `o`: sort by groups
- `l`: sort by brightness (default)
